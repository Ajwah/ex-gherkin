{"gherkinDocument":{"uri":"/Users/kevinjohnson/projects/ex_gherkin/test/support/testdata/full_features/world.feature","feature":{"location":{"line":1,"column":1},"language":"en","keyword":"Feature","name":"World","description":"  In order to isolate each test scenario, the steps definitions belonging to the\n  same scenario will run in a isolated context, called 'world'. A world also\n  contains the helpers methods that will be used in the step definitions.\n\n  It is possible to add helpers methods to a world in three different ways:\n\n  1. Passing a module. In this case its methods will be added directly to the\n     world and be usable in the step definitions.\n\n  2. Passing a block, where the return value is the world object.\n\n  3. Passing a hash, where the keys are namespaces and the values are\n     modules. In this case, the methods of each module will be accessible using\n     the key as prefix.","children":[{"scenario":{"location":{"line":18,"column":3},"keyword":"Scenario","name":"A world is extended
