# ExGherkin

Elixir implementation for `Gherkin`-language.
Status: Feature-complete but still more documentation work required.

The purpose of this project is to be at least functionally equivalent to
the [official `ruby` implementation](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/tree/master/gherkin/ruby)
In order to realize this, detailed tests have been implemented to compare
the output generated by the official tools with the output generated in
the tests.

It is intentionally coined in its own dedicated `repo` to facilitate
others, such as `white_bread` and `cabbage`, to leverage this `parser`.

## Road Forward
* [ ] Introduce more detailed documentation:
    * [ ] Better examples as to how to effectively use this parser
    * [ ] Create online documentation to clarify `Syntax`-errors
    * [ ] Provide a detailed account of the various tests implemented
    that are to proof that this is functionally equivalent to the `ruby`-
    implementation.
* [ ] Take feedback from the official team to have this `repo`to be
included in the [mono-repo](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber)
eventually.
* [ ] CI/CD.
* [ ] Implement `Cucumber` using this tool.
* [ ] Publish to Hex.

## Tools

1. Mix tasks:
    1. `mix gherkin_languages`:
       * input: `gherkin-languages.json`
       * output: `gherkin-languages.terms`
       * supply variety of options to control:
         * which subset of languages desired
         * homonyms
    2. `mix ast_ndjson`:
       * input: `*.feature`
       * output: `*.feature.ast.ndjson`
       * dependency: `gherkin`-executable
2. `generate-tokens`:
   * input: `*.feature`
   * output: `*.feature.tokens`
   * dependency: `gherkin`-executable

The dependency referred to above can be installed by:
* `gem install cucumber`

## API
```elixir
"""
Feature: Minimal

  Scenario: minimalistic
    Given the minimalism

"""
|> ExGherkin.prepare
|> ExGherkin.run
```

```elixir
[path: "path_to.feature"
|> ExGherkin.prepare
|> ExGherkin.run
```

For fine granular control, there are two parts:

1. `Scanner.tokenize/1,2` to tokenize the `feature` file. This leverages
`gherkin-languages.terms` to provide `i18n`-support. Technically
speaking, one could coin one's own domain language specific keywords to
denote `Given`, `When`, `Then` etc.

2. `Parser.run/1` to convert the tokens obtained into `AST`-tree.
Leverages `yecc` parser under the hood.


Kindly consult the test-files for more detailed usage.

## Configuration
`config.exs` provides you with config options that mainly relate to the
`mix`-tasks listed above.
